                My name is Joseph and I'm a student at the University of Washington studying and learning how to build 
                web apps through the Coding Bootcamp! I am originally from the New England area where I grew up and went
                to school. I graduated from Great Bay Community College with an Associates in Buisness Management and 
                then went on to finish my Bachelors of Arts at the University of New Hampshire in Communications with a
                focus in Marketing, Social Media, and Crisis Management.

                Currently I am working in big tech at <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/universityvillage/">Apple University Village </a> 
                where I am an Expert on the sales team. I am looking to further my development within Apple by learning how to build
                websites using code so I can help enrich lives and make amazing products and services!
